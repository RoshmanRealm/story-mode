Vast ancient civilisation wiped out by "The Darkness", state this in the spawn books in the format of a mission log kind of thing.
Leave some co-ordinates at the end which lead to a cave filled with the End Gate block (should look Taken-esque)
Travel so far it teleports you into a room, pitch black, has title commands saying things like "YOu shouldnt have come here", "youre going
to die here", "the darkness feeds on your light."
After that, teleport them to a clone of spawn filled with dark blocks and void blocks, replace books with new ones, explaining that that
spawn is from the future, and that there is no way to stop it. Leave co-ordinates to where hes going to sacrifice himself to save the world
even if it doesn't work.
Teleport them back once they open a chest and take out an eye of ender named "Key to The Darkness"

Once they kill the dragon, on one of the pillars, there will be co-ordinates to a button which will take them to Horde Mode's backstory.
Horde Mode backstory - Killing the dragon stopped the darkness from spreading, but created gateways for hordes of enemys to enter this
realm.
